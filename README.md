## Quality Settings

### JPEG Quality
- **Maximum**: Highest quality, larger file size
- **High**: Very good quality with reasonable file size
- **Medium**: Good quality with smaller file size
- **Low**: Reduced quality with minimal file size

### PNG Compression
- **Maximum**: Highest compression, smaller files (slower)
- **Normal**: Balanced compression and speed
- **Fast**: Quick compression with larger files
- **None**: No compression, largest file size but fastest

### PDF Resolution
- **72 DPI**: Web quality
- **150 DPI**: Good for general use
- **300 DPI**: Print quality
- **600 DPI**: High-detail print quality

## AI Models

- **anime**: Optimized for anime and cartoon images
- **photo**: Best for photographs and realistic images
- **general**: Good all-purpose model for mixed content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Slow Processing**: AI upscaling is GPU-intensive. Try using a smaller scale factor or processing fewer files at once.
- **Out of Memory**: Close other applications or reduce the number of files being processed simultaneously.
- **Unsupported File**: Ensure your files are not corrupted and are in a supported format.

### GPU Compatibility

The application will automatically detect your GPU capabilities. For optimal AI upscaling performance:
- Use a dedicated GPU rather than integrated graphics
- Ensure your graphics drivers are up to date
- Close other GPU-intensive applications while processing

## Privacy

This application processes all files locally on your computer. No files or data are uploaded to external servers.
